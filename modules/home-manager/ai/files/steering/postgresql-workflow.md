# PostgreSQL Workflow

This file is required reading for any PostgreSQL-related task — patches, internals questions, performance investigation, design discussion, or extension development. PostgreSQL is the user's primary work domain (≈22.8k topic mentions in chat history); applying this consistently saves substantial time per task.

## Rule of First Resort: Use `postgresq` MCP, Not Manual Search

The `postgresq` MCP server (https://pg.ddx.io/mcp) indexes the entire pgsql-hackers archive (76k+ messages) plus the upstream `master` git history with author/date/thread metadata. Before reaching for `grep`, `rg`, web search, or asking the user for context:

1. **Patch design questions** ("why does X work this way", "has Y been proposed before") → `postgresq` thread search.
2. **Symbol lookup** (`BufferDesc`, `XLogInsert`, executor node X) → `postgresq` symbol+history search.
3. **Reviewer objections in this area** ("what did the community say about lockless approaches") → `postgresq` thread search filtered by reviewer name or subject pattern.
4. **Cross-reference commit ↔ thread** ("what discussion led to commit `abc1234`") → `postgresq` git→list correlation.
5. **Community coding conventions** for a specific area → `postgresq` codified in conventions corpus.

If `postgresq` returns insufficient results, *then* fall back to web search or manual grep. Don't skip the MCP because "it might not have it" — it usually does.

**Do NOT use `postgresq` for:**

- Running SQL queries (use a regular Postgres client)
- Reading the user's own extensions (`ra`, `pg_dyn`, etc.) — those are local code, use file Read/git MCP
- Current end-user PostgreSQL documentation (use `context7` for postgres-the-database-docs)
- GitHub PRs/issues against forks/extensions (use `github` MCP)

## Patch Series Workflow

When the user asks for a patch or patch series targeting upstream PostgreSQL or one of their extensions:

1. **Phase 0 — Context gathering** (before touching code)
   - `postgresq` search for prior threads on the topic. Read the top 3–5.
   - `postgresq` git history for the area being modified — understand recent churn.
   - If the user already has a draft or referenced a commit, `postgresq` it for the original design discussion.

2. **Phase 1 — Design**
   - State the design intent in 2–4 sentences. Surface known trade-offs before writing code.
   - If a similar design was already reviewed and rejected on -hackers, surface the rejection reason and discuss whether it still applies.

3. **Phase 2 — Implementation**
   - Follow PostgreSQL coding conventions: 4-space indent, `PG_TRY/CATCH` for resource cleanup, `ereport()` for errors with `errcode()`, `palloc` not `malloc`, minimal use of `bool`-returning functions.
   - One logical change per commit. Patch series order: prep/refactor commits first, behavior-changing commits last.
   - If you're adding a `GUC`, it goes in `guc_tables.c` and `postgresql.conf.sample` together.

4. **Phase 3 — Testing**
   - Build with `--enable-cassert --enable-debug --enable-tap-tests`.
   - Run the relevant test suite: `make check`, `make installcheck`, the relevant `src/test/regress` group, or the appropriate TAP suite.
   - For buffer manager / WAL / recovery changes: also run `pg_amcheck` or the relevant `pg_isolated` tests.

5. **Phase 4 — Submission**
   - Commit message: present-tense imperative, ≤72 char subject, body explains the *why* not the *what*. Include reproducer if fixing a bug.
   - For -hackers submission: cover letter explains the patch series, lists open questions, references prior threads (`postgresq` link or `[1]` style).
   - For local PR against a fork: use the `github` MCP to open with full context.

## Performance Investigation Workflow

1. **First**: ask the user for the workload shape (read-heavy / write-heavy / mixed, working set size, isolation level). Don't guess.
2. **Reproduce**: a minimal `pgbench` or `psql` script that exhibits the issue. Time it. Get a baseline.
3. **Profile**: `perf record -p <pid>` for CPU; `bpftrace`/`bcc-tools` for syscalls/IO; `pg_stat_statements` for query-level. Use the `pg-numa-benchmark` skill (see `~/.kiro/skills/pg-numa-benchmark/`) when on bare-metal hardware.
4. **Hypothesize then test**: change one variable at a time. Don't combine config changes.

### A/B feature benchmarking (vs `master`)

When measuring a feature branch's impact, always compare against its **merge-base with `origin/master`**, not against an arbitrary master tip -- that isolates the feature from unrelated upstream churn. Build both variants from the same checkout (one `build.sh`-style script that `git checkout --detach`es each rev into its own prefix), refuse to run with a dirty tree, and emit machine-readable results (CSV) plus a human summary (Markdown) under a timestamped results dir so runs are comparable over time. Record TPS, latency, WAL volume, the relevant per-feature counters (e.g. HOT vs HOT-indexed vs non-HOT update counts), index/table bloat before/after, and peak CPU/RSS. Re-run the same harness after every rebase so regressions are caught against current master.

## Concrete Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These have appeared repeatedly in chat history and should not recur:

- **Reaching for `grep` against pgsql-hackers archives** — always use `postgresq` first.
- **Asking the user "what did the community say about X"** — `postgresq` knows; check it first.
- **Implementing a feature without checking prior art** — half the time someone already proposed it; understanding why it stalled saves the same dead-end.
- **Manually reading commit logs to find motivation** — `postgresq` correlates commits to their list threads.
- **Mixing patch series ordering** (behavior + refactor in one commit) — split.
- **Skipping the cassert build** — undefined-behavior bugs only show under cassert.

## When in Doubt

Ask `postgresq` first. If the response is empty or unhelpful, only then fall back to other tools. Document the gap so the corpus can be improved.

## Patch-Series Discipline (hard-won on the HOT-indexed / `tepid` work; recurring)

These are explicit, repeated requirements for any series aimed at -hackers. Treat them as acceptance criteria, not aspirations.

- **Every commit builds clean on its own**, with `-Werror` and `--enable-cassert --enable-injection-points`. Zero warnings. A reviewer will `git rebase --exec 'make'` the series; any commit that fails is disqualifying.
- **Every commit passes `make check` on its own** (not just the tip). Bundle each test with the commit that introduces the feature it exercises; later commits may amend that test. A commit that leaves a regress test red is not submittable even if the tip is green.
- **Foundational changes precede their consumers, and must keep every existing consumer correct *at that commit*.** Do not land an infrastructure change in an early patch that breaks a still-upstream consumer until a later patch repairs it. If a change is only correct once its new consumer exists, put the change *in the commit with the consumer*. (Concrete miss: broadening a relcache attr bitmap in the infra patch silently broke heap_update's still-upstream HOT decision for BRIN until the write-path patch rewired it. Fix was to move the one broadening line into the write-path commit.)
- **Minimize churn between commits.** Do not add code in one commit and delete it in another within the same series. If you catch yourself doing that, the change belongs in a different commit.
- **Typedefs go in `src/tools/pgindent/typedefs.list` in the same commit that introduces the type.**
- **Each commit must stand on its own as a defensible idea** with a self-contained rationale in its message.
- **Commit messages**: imperative subject <=72 chars; body explains *why*, not *what*; reference prior `-hackers` threads. No agent attribution, no co-authors unless code is genuinely derived from another contributor's work (e.g. ZHeap-descended table-AM plumbing -> `Co-authored-by:` the real author). Otherwise author is the user.
- **ASCII only** in code, comments, docs, and commit messages. No project codename leaking into identifiers (the `tepid` work forbade the "SIU" acronym in-tree; user-facing name is "HOT with selective index updates", in-source identifier `hot_indexed`).
- **A local-only dev-setup commit** (Nix env, editor config) stays as the first commit and is excluded from the submitted series; the feature branch holds the squashed/clean product, not the development history.

## Verifying a Series Per-Commit (mechanics that bite)

- **meson caches the initdb template.** The `setup` test suite builds `tmp_install/initdb-template`; it is *not* regenerated when you `git checkout` a different commit. Stale templates produce false regress diffs (catalog columns from the wrong commit, e.g. `system_views.sql`) and false passes. To test a commit honestly: `trash tmp_install testrun; meson test --suite setup` (regenerate) before `meson test --suite regress`.
- **ninja mtime traps.** Editing a file that was just `git checkout`-ed may not bump its mtime enough for ninja to rebuild; the build silently uses stale objects. When verifying a specific edit, `touch -d <future> <file>` to force the recompile, and confirm the expected object actually compiles in the output.
- **Distinguish stale-build / stale-template confounds from real regressions before concluding anything.** This wasted real time: a "threshold=0 passes" result was a stale binary; a per-commit "rules.out" diff was a stale template. Rebuild + regenerate template, then re-measure, before forming a hypothesis.
- **Bisect deterministic test failures across the series** (`git checkout` each commit, build, run the single failing spec) to find the introducing commit; that almost always names the root cause.
- **Reproduce isolation/TAP failures standalone**: `initdb` a scratch cluster, drive two `psql` sessions plus the injection point by hand. Gives full error visibility and a live backend to attach.
- `gdb -p <pid> -batch -ex 'bt'` for hangs; inspect `PrivateRefCountArray` for held buffer pins and `BufferDescriptors[n].bufferdesc.tag` to identify which relation/block a pin or cleanup-lock is stuck on.

## Git Mechanics & Safety (repeated)

- **Never force-push** (a hook blocks it). To rewrite a published branch after explicit approval: create a backup branch and push it (`git branch bkp <ref>; git push origin bkp:bkp`), then `git push origin --delete <branch>` and `git push origin <branch>` fresh. Always back up before any history rewrite.
- **`git add` named paths only** -- never `git add .`/`-A`/`-u`. Don't commit agent artifacts (`.agent/`, `AGENTS.md`, notes); keep them in `.local-gitignore`.
- **`GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=cat` does not "preview" a rebase -- it *executes* it** (cat exits 0, so the unmodified todo is accepted and run). For a real no-op preview, write the todo to a file and inspect it. For scripted rebases use `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true GIT_EDITOR=true` (non-interactive) or a Python sequence-editor that rewrites the todo.
- **Reorder/relocate changes across commits** with `edit` stops (amend at each) or `--fixup=<sha>` + `git rebase -i --autosquash`. `--autosquash` auto-positions `fixup!` commits under their target; you only hand-move genuine reorders.

## PostgreSQL-Internals Gotchas (verified the hard way)

- **HOT determination must compare actual tuple values over the indexed-attr bitmap; do not shortcut via the SQL target list.** `ExecGetAllUpdatedCols()` misses indexed columns mutated outside the SET clause: BEFORE/INSTEAD-OF triggers using `heap_modify_tuple()` (`tsvector_update_trigger`), `FOR PORTION OF` temporal columns, exclusion constraints, and synthetic-`ResultRelInfo` callers (REPACK CONCURRENTLY apply, logical-replication apply). Upstream's `HeapDetermineColumnsInfo` always compares; match that.
- **Synthetic `ResultRelInfo` callers** (REPACK CONCURRENTLY apply has `ri_RangeTableIndex == 0`; logical-rep apply populates `updatedCols` on a synthetic RTE) make any `ExecGet*Cols()` result non-authoritative. Code that consumes the SQL target list must guard for, or simply avoid, these callers.
- **`INDEX_ATTR_BITMAP_*` semantics matter and are easy to get subtly wrong.** The non-summarizing set drives the HOT-blocking decision; `INDEX_ATTR_BITMAP_SUMMARIZED` is deliberately "columns *only* in summarizing indexes" (the `bms_del_members` against the non-summarizing set) so a column shared by a btree and a BRIN is *not* treated as summarizing-only -- otherwise an "all-summarizing" fast-path wrongly classifies its update as classic-HOT and leaves a stale btree entry.
- **btree leaf-pin retention vs VACUUM cleanup lock.** `so->dropPin` historically gated on `!xs_want_itup` as a proxy for "is index-only scan." Setting `xs_want_itup` on a *plain* index scan (e.g. to recheck a leaf key) then wrongly retains the leaf pin across the scan's tuple processing, which blocks VACUUM's cleanup lock behind a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row-lock wait -> hang. Gate `dropPin` on an explicit "index-only" flag instead: `xs_itup` is copied into `so->currTuples` (scan-local), so a heap-fetching plain scan never needs the pin; only IOS does (VM all-visible / TID-recycle race). The planner's `get_actual_variable_endpoint()` scan sets `xs_want_itup` but uses `SnapshotNonVacuumable`, so `IsMVCCLikeSnapshot()` already keeps its pin regardless.
- **A leaf-key recheck needs the stored leaf key for *dedup*, not just qual re-evaluation.** Re-running `indexqualorig` against the live tuple drops false positives but cannot dedup two index entries that chain-walk to the same live tuple (-> duplicate rows). Per-scan TID dedup (the `systable_getnext` approach) works for equality catalog scans but breaks `ORDER BY` (returns the tuple at the stale key's sort position). The stored-leaf-key comparison is the correct general mechanism.
- **System-catalog index consistency after a relfilenode swap.** CLUSTER / VACUUM FULL / REPACK `UPDATE pg_class SET relfilenode` is itself subject to HOT decisions; an *unchanged* index (e.g. `pg_class`'s relname index) chain-walks to the new tuple and must be recheck-*kept*, or a direct `SELECT ... WHERE relname = ...` via the executor index-scan path silently returns no row even though the table is fine. Internal catalog access goes through `systable_getnext` (HeapKeyTest + TID dedup); direct SQL on a catalog goes through the executor IndexScan path -- both must agree.

## Empirical Discipline (the user enforces this)

- **Do not assert "behavior-preserving" or "fixed" without evidence.** Prove it: compare the failing artifact at the commit-before vs commit-after; show the test going from red to green; show the standalone repro now returning the right answer.
- **When asked to "verify first," verify and present the evidence before implementing.** Reason through alternatives explicitly and say why the chosen one wins; don't silently pick one.

## Comment Conventions (PostgreSQL house style)

These are the project's conventions for comments in patches to core and in
extension code written to match it. They are stricter than general-purpose
commenting advice and they are what reviewers on pgsql-hackers expect.

- No comment is the default. Code should explain itself, and a comment
  that states the obvious is noise in the diff.
- A comment earns its place by telling the reader something non-obvious
  — the why, the constraint, the case the code can't show — pitched a
  level above the code, in simple words. Usually that takes a sentence
  or two; when a subtlety obviously demands a long comment, write the
  long comment.
- Comments describe the code as it stands — noting previous behavior is
  rarely needed. Leave comments outside the patch's footprint alone,
  unless the patch has made them out-of-date or inaccurate; updating
  those is part of the change.
- A fix restores intended behavior; it's rarely an occasion to add
  comments the original code did without. Don't comment defensively
  against edits that haven't happened.
- The default above is for patches to existing code. New code I write
  is commented generously: a header comment on nearly every new
  function (summary, then the caller contract), a short full-sentence
  step comment above each phase of a nontrivial one ("Quick exit if
  we already did this."), and multi-sentence blocks for the why and
  the constraints.
- Block comments sit above the code, in complete sentences with a
  capital and a period. Trailing same-line comments are only for
  struct members and short guards, as telegraphic fragments.
- "Note that ..." is the house connective. "NB:" flags a caller
  contract or trap. "XXX" marks an acknowledged hack, nothing else.
  Never "FIXME", never a "Note:" label.

## Tests (community norms)

- The bar for adding a test is high. Simple fixes routinely ship without
  one; that is the community norm, not a corner cut.
- A warranted test is minimal and simple, not exhaustive. Cover the case
  that matters and skip variations that prove nothing new; redundant
  coverage is a cost, not a safety margin.
- Blend new tests into the existing suite. Extend a nearby block in its
  own style rather than building new scaffolding. A new block or file is
  sometimes right, but treat it as the exception.
- Calibration: roughly one in six behavior fixes ships with a test. When
  one does, it is a graft — single statements inside an existing block,
  reusing its roles and fixtures and copying its local idioms (e.g., the
  "-- fail" markers).
- TAP description strings are lowercase and telegraphic, echoing the
  thing under test: 'vacuumdb --dry-run'. Comments inside test files are
  still full sentences.

## Docs (SGML)

- Present tense, one point per <para>. Caveats become "Note that ..."
  sentences or a <note>.
- GUC descriptions follow the skeleton: "Specifies the ...  The default
  is X.  This parameter can only be set ...".
- Prefer a varlistentry list over a table when items deserve anchors.
  Alphabetize where order carries no meaning.
- A missing word is a standalone "doc:" commit, not a passenger on
  another change.

## Commit messages (PostgreSQL house style)

Extends the generic rules in prose-mechanics.md; where they differ, these
win.

- Subject: "area: Imperative summary." — capitalized, about 50
  characters, and yes, the trailing period. The area prefix is a tool or
  module name in its in-tree lowercase spelling (pg_upgrade:, vacuumdb:,
  doc:). Backend changes get no prefix.
- Body prose is hard-wrapped at 67 columns. One or two paragraphs is the
  norm; a "* " list only for genuinely enumerable sub-changes.
- Fix shape: the broken behavior in present tense ("Presently, ..."),
  then its consequence, then "To fix, ...".
- Attribution closes as its own paragraph: "Oversight in commit
  <10-hex-hash>.", plus "Per buildfarm." or "Per Coverity." when that is
  the source. Trivial fixups can be a subject line and little else.
- Prior commits are "commit " + 10-hex hash, including in lists
  ("commits 30e7c175b8, e469f0aaf3, and 492046fa9e").
- The palette, used naturally and never all at once: "This commit ...",
  "While at it, ...", "In passing, ...", "teach X to Y", "left as a
  future exercise", "This is preparatory work for a follow-up commit
  that will ...", "Bumps catversion." Risk is hedged by understatement:
  "seems unlikely to cause too much trouble in practice".
- Trailers, one person per line as Name <email>, in this order: Bug /
  Reported-by / Suggested-by, then Author / Co-authored-by, Reviewed-by,
  Tested-by, Security, Discussion, and Backpatch-through always last. No
  Author: line for sole-author work. Discussion is a percent-encoded
  https://postgr.es/m/ link, omitted on CVE commits and trivial fixups.
- Scale to the change; model commits worth imitating: 626d7236b65 (a big
  feature), 158408fef8b (a subtle fix), 1fbe2066dcc (a bug fix).

## Minimization

- Aim for the smallest patch that does the job well — code, comments, and
  tests alike. It reads faster in review and keeps needless churn off the
  tree.
- There are exceptions, but they are earned. Put real effort into making
  the patch fit nicely before concluding that it cannot.
- Split series: a framework commit, then one conversion per commit.
  Re-pgindent and .git-blame-ignore-revs updates are their own commits.
- One adjacent cleanup may ride along if the message flags it with
  "While at it, ...". Anything more is deferred and named ("left as a
  future exercise").
- Comment-only fixes are their own commits, never passengers.

## E-mail to the pgsql lists

Plain text wrapped near 72 columns, interleaved under trimmed quotes. No
greeting and no closing, ever: the client supplies the attribution line
and the signature, so a draft starts with content and just ends.

- Default to short. The median reply is about four lines, and a one-line
  reply is normal ("Committed.", "WFM.", "Done.", "Agreed.").
- Content goes below the quote it answers. The only thing above the first
  quote is a one-line meta note: "Thanks for the report.", "Thanks for
  taking a look.", "Committed." Trim quotes hard and mark cuts with
  "> [...]".
- Thread-starts open cold with the discovery ("While <doing X>, I noticed
  that ..."), then evidence (commit hashes, [0]-indexed footnote URLs
  above the sig), then the proposal and patch, ending "Thoughts?" or "Am
  I missing something?".
- Reviews anchor on pasted diff hunks with the comment underneath,
  per-patch verdicts like "Otherwise, 0001 looks good.", and minor points
  as "nitpick:  ..." with an out ("but others might find your version
  easier to read").
- Approvals: "WFM.", "Seems reasonable.", "Looks reasonable to me.",
  "+1", "Agreed." Never "LGTM", never a "-1" vote.
- Disagreement: "I don't think we want to ...", "I'm not seeing why we
  wouldn't just ...", "I am quite dubious we need to do anything here."
  Retraction ends with "Sorry for the noise."
- Process formulas: "Here is what I have staged for commit."; "Barring
  additional feedback, I plan to commit this soon."; "I'd like to proceed
  with committing this in the next couple of days if there are no
  objections."; close the loop with "Committed." plus any caveats.
- Asks are "Would you mind ...?" / "Can you ...?", almost never "please".
- In stock: IIUC, AFAICT, IMHO (never IMO), FWIW, "folks", "Yeah," and
  "Ah," openers. Same voice to everyone; newcomers just additionally get
  the process spelled out (commitfest entry, cfbot).

## Postgres-specific prose mechanics

Extends prose-mechanics.md for this project only.

- Versions are "v17". Maintenance branches are "the back-branches".
  "back-patch" is hyphenated. The product is "Postgres" in casual prose.
- GUCs, options, and file names stay bare, unquoted and unmarked.
